For the project we used the trailer of the penguin. The steps we used were as follows:
1. creation of the dialogue (it was made of kitchen by a scene where a jar with red stuff is shown).
2. Use of text-to-speech AI 
3. choice of background songs 
4. Stitching everything together in audacity using cuts, tempo changes to fit the moment they are talking and audio gain, audio fading for transitions.
5. Also use the original audio to check if the sounds are in tempo.
6. Join the modified audio with the original video using clipchamp.

The objective of the project was to change the meaning of the video through audio.
